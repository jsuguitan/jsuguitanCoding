//How to compile both cpp file programs
make

//to run sequential and/or parallel project First
//start with creating the textfile with the set amount of numbers by doing:
sbatch create.sh
//changing the number in the int2640 file will change how many rows and columns will be created
//currently there will be 2640 rows and columns with there being 2640 ^ 2 numbers in the file 
//  after running create.sh


if // you want to input your own matrix 
        //either change the final word of the srun to
        srun dynamic <Your File>    //for the parallel in dyn9.sh
        srun sequence <Your File>   //for the sequential in seq.sh

        //or you can change the whats inside the int2640
        Note: You must put how many rows will be used as the first number in the file
        

//next to run the sequential use

sbatch seq.sh
// the output of program file goes to "seqOut.out"

//instructions to see the actual sorted array is in the src/sequential.cpp file


//to run the parallel use

sbatch dyn9.sh
// the output dynamicTiming.out

// to change how many processors used
goto dyn9.sh 
    change the 3rd line to the correct number of processors

Note: processors number must be able to be square rooted


//information on how to turn on or off printing the matrix is on both parallel.cpp and sequential.cpp



Below i how the file should look like on how to input your own matirx

The 4 represents how many rows/columns there will be
The 1st group of numbers is matrix A
The 2nd group of numbers is matrix B

//How to compile both cpp file programs
make

//to run sequential of the project First
//start with creating the textfile with the set amount of numbers by doing:
sbatch create.sh
//changing the number in the int500000000 file will change how many numbers are used

//next to run the sequential use

sbatch seq.sh
// the output of program file goes to "seqOut.out"

//instructions to see the actual sorted array is in the src/sequential.cpp file


//to run the parallel use

sbatch dyn8.sh
// the output dynamicTiming.out


//information on how to print sorted array is on both parallel.cpp and sequential.cpp

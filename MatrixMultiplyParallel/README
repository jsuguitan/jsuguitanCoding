//How to compile both cpp file programs
make

//how to run sequential without inputting matricies
sbatch createA.sh
sbatch createB.sh
sbatch seq.sh

//how to run parallel without inputting matricies
sbatch createA.sh
sbatch createB.sh
sbatch dyn.sh






What each .sh does


createA.sh
//puts in values into matrixA.  The number of values into matrixA is dependent on the first number of matrixA. i.e ) If the first number in file matrixA is 9.  9^2 numbers will put on the file


createB.sh
//puts in values into matrixB.  The number of values into matrixA is dependent on the first number of matrixB. i.e ) If the first number in file matrixA is 9.  9^2 numbers will put on the file


The first number of matrixA and matrixB must be the same to make the matrix multiplication to work



if // you want to input your own matrix 
        //either change the final word of the srun to
        
        // in dyn.sh
        srun dynamic <Your File1 > <Your File2 >  //for the parallel in dyn.sh
        
        // in seq.sh
        srun sequence <Your File1 > <Your File2 >   //for the sequential in seq.sh

        //or you can change the whats inside the matrixA and matrixB
        Note: You must put how many rows will be used as the first number in the file
        

//next to run the sequential use

sbatch seq.sh
// the output of program file goes to "seqOut.out"



//to run the parallel use

sbatch dyn.sh
// the output dynamicTiming.out

// to change how many processors used
goto dyn.sh 
    change the 3rd line to the correct number of processors

Note: processors number must be able to be square rooted


//information on how to turn on or off printing the matrix is on both parallel.cpp and sequential.cpp



Below i how the file should look like on how to input your own matirx

The 4 represents how many rows/columns there will be
The 1st group of numbers is matrix A
